Bell your wordpress website with browser notification in minutes. Send push notifications to your users on browsers like Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

== Description ==

Installing the plugin adds a notification bell (Refer Screenshot) and subscribe button (only posts) on your website. Users click the bell to subscribe for notifications on browsers like Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Subscribe button is at the end of the blog helps better conversions as readers subscribe more after reading a blog. The message for bell and button are both customisable to suit your needs. The plugin will integrate more browsers as they start supporting push notifications. 

Browser push notifications can be used to engage with your users without mobile app installs, cold emails, SMSes or even bringing the user to your website. You can send new updates to your users using Pushchamp APIs or dashboard.
